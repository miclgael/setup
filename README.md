# üçé setup

Opinionated notes and scripts for setting up a fresh macOS computer for web development _(Follow at your own risk / benefit)_

> üí° I also have guides for [Linux](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-linux) and [Windows](https://github.com/miclgael/setup-win)!

**NB: Requires macOS 11+ (ideally macOS 12+)**

## ‚ú® Automated install

If its your first time here, I'd recommend skipping this automated install and following the steps manually. This will give you a chance to read the instructions and make sure you're happy with everything.

If you just want to run the whole thing in one go, you can use the following command:

<details>
  <summary>üöß Are you sure you want to automate this?</summary>
  <details>
    <summary>Yes, please reveal</summary>

    bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/miclgael/setup/main/scripts/main.sh)

  </details>
</details>

Or you can just clone the repo, CD in and run `sh scripts/main.sh`

Please note, even if you do run the automated install, you'll still need to manually clean-up some steps at the end. So its a good idea to keep this README around.

## Steps:

### üçª Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

- Installs Xcode command line tools
- Installs Git!
- Gives access to the `brew` command.

### Install Git Large File Storage

I like to immediately install this, otherwise I forget and then things go haywire later when I pull down a repo that needs lfs.

```bash
brew install git-lfs
```

### üí§ Install zsh and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)

**Zsh should be installed first!** See [installing zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) or use brew:

```bash
brew install zsh
```

(follow the instructions)

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

(follow the instructions, again)

Install plugins

```bash
brew install spaceship zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting
``` 
(no need to follow the instructions if using `./dotfiles/modules/sources.sh`)

### Configure Git Signing (GNUPG)

This can be an awful process but I found [this](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key) [combination](https://dev.to/wes/how2-using-gpg-on-macos-without-gpgtools-428f) of [solutions](https://gist.github.com/johnwgillis/e32e98846ec6136cb597dab57f0f7166#how-to-setup-gpg-for-signing-commits-with-git-sourcetree-and-github-on-mac) to work well for me.

<details>
  <summary>Full steps here</summary>

```bash
brew install gnupg pinentry-mac
```

> Quit and reopen your terminal here. Heck, restart your machine.

Create and append pinentry, "allowing the gpg key's passphrase to be stored in the login keychain, enabling automatic key signing". - Wes

```bash
mkdir -m 700 -p ~/.gnupg && \
touch ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf && \
echo "pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac" >> ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf &&\
killall gpg-agent
```

Create a new key that will work locally and also with Github.

```bash
gpg --default-new-key-algo rsa4096 --gen-key
```

Test GPG is working

```
echo "test" | gpg --clearsign
```

- List the keys
- Copy line #2 to your clipboard

```
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long | grep sec -A 1
```

Print ASCII version of the key, for Github.

```
gpg --export --armor YOUR_GPG_KEY_HERE | pbcopy
```

Then, paste the output into [GitHub‚Äôs GPG settings page](https://github.com/settings/gpg/new)

Finally, tell git about your key

```
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_GPG_KEY_HERE
git config --global commit.gpgsign true
git config --global gpg.program gpg
```

#### Setup GPG in Sourcetree

```
ln -s /usr/local/bin/gpg /usr/local/bin/gpg2
```

In Sourcetree, go to advanced settings and point the gpg file to `/usr/local/bin`

#### Troubleshooting

```
brew unlink gpg && brew link gpg
```

```
# Kill gpg-agent
killall gpg-agent

# Run gpg-agent in daemon mode
gpg-agent --daemon
```

### üë©‚Äçüíª Install development software

```bash
brew install --cask iterm2 visual-studio-code mamp codekit tableplus tower obsidian insomnia docker fastfetch && \
brew install --cask google-chrome firefox homebrew/cask-versions/firefox-developer-edition && \
brew install composer
```

**[Micro editor](https://micro-editor.github.io/) (nicer than Nano, easier than Vim)**

```bash
brew install micro
```

### üíª Install preferred VS Code extensions

There are a few ways to handle this, depending on your flavour of VS Code.

1. Easy: If you don't care about telemetry, just use the [built-in sync functions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync) in VS Code. Note: a Microsoft or Github<sup>\*</sup> account is required
2. Medium: If you're using VS Codium, you might like to try the [Settings Sync extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync). Connect to a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/miclgael/79b65d3420f95a943eb9bf94be1399c5) in order to save your settings
3. Hard: Manually install using the command line, `code --install-extension <extension-name>`. You could still save your settings to a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/miclgael/fec1768d31c92a580a3b0a28688a29e9))

```zsh
# place this after nvm initialization!
autoload -U add-zsh-hook
load-nvmrc() {
  local node_version="$(nvm version)"
  local nvmrc_path="$(nvm_find_nvmrc)"

  if [ -n "$nvmrc_path" ]; then
    local nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version "$(cat "${nvmrc_path}")")

    if [ "$nvmrc_node_version" = "N/A" ]; then
      nvm install
    elif [ "$nvmrc_node_version" != "$node_version" ]; then
